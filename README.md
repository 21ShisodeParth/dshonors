# L&S 88 - Final Project Information

This repository will (eventually) contain a sample final project for you to reference as you go about creating yours. For now, it serves to hold the assignments that you will complete along the way.

## Step 1 Assignment

This assignment is to be completed first individually and again as a team once you have chosen your data set. Look for an interesting study in Dataverse, OSF, and/or Zenodo

* What is the quality (you can use F.A.I.R) of the information?
* What is the provenance and collection method of the data?
* What are the hypotheses of the project?
* What are the research methods?
* What license is available?
* Can you open the project files?
 
Upload a Markdown (.md) file to bCourses to submit for the individual assignment. For the team assignment, add the Markdown file to the `subassignments` folder of your Github repo.

"Source: 2021 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates"
"Estimates in the People, Workers, Housing, Socioeconomic, and Education tabs are from the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is an annual household survey developed by the U.S. Census Bureau to replace the long form of the decennial census program. Each year, the ACS samples about 3.5 million household addresses to produce nearly 11 billion estimates covering demographic, social, economic, and housing characteristics."
"Except where noted, 'race' refers to people reporting only one race.  'Hispanic' refers to an ethnic category;  Hispanics may be of any race."
"An '-' The estimate could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations. For a ratio of medians estimate, one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution. For a 5-year median estimate, the margin of error associated with a median was larger than the median itself."
"median- The median falls in the lowest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example '2,500-')"
"median+ The median falls in the highest interval of an open-ended distribution (for example '250,000+')"
"An '**' The margin of error could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations."
"An '***' The margin of error could not be computed because the median falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution. "
"An '*****' A margin of error is not appropriate because the corresponding estimate is controlled to an independent population or housing estimate. Effectively, the corresponding estimate has no sampling error and the margin of error may be treated as zero. "
"An 'N' The estimate or margin of error cannot be displayed because there were an insufficient number of sample cases in the selected geographic area."
"An '(X)' The estimate or margin of error is not applicable or not available.  "
"If calculating a percentage, use the total population line within the section as the denominator. Do not use total population lines from other sections since these may have different universes."

"Source: 2020 County Business Patterns for Congressional Districts"
"1. CBP data includes the number of establishments, employment during the week of March 12, and annual payroll. CBP basic data are extracted from the Business Register (BR), a database of all known single and multi-establishment employer companies maintained and updated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Primary causes of differences between CBP employment estimates and ACS estimates: CBP does not cover the self-employed, public employment, and most agricultural employment; CBP estimates are not based on a sample survey; they represent business location as opposed to workers' residence in the district; use the week of March 12 as a reference period; and use a business source to determine industry."
"2. Industries not classified - Industry could not be determined."
"3. Statewide - County Business Patterns data includes employers without a fixed location within a state (or of unknown county location), these are included under a 'statewide' classification. Statewide cases are not included in any particular congressional district (though they would be included in at-large districts). This incomplete detail causes only a slight understatement of a district's total estimates."
"4. Disclosure and Quality Indicator Flag Definitions:"
"G Cell value changed by less than 2 percent by the application of noise"
"H Cell value changed by at least 2 percent but less than 5 percent by the application of noise"
"J Cell value changed by 5 percent or more by the application of noise"
"S Cell value withheld because it did not meet publication standards"
"N Not available or not comparable"
"X Not applicable"
